# 32-bit vs 64-bit: One-Byte Explainer

*This is a submission for [DEV Computer Science Challenge v24.06.12: One Byte Explainer](https://dev.to/challenges/cs).*

## Explainer

> A 64-bit system is like a highway, while a 32-bit system is like a bypass road. 

> A 64-bit system allows more data to be transmitted simultaneously, resulting in improved overall speed and performance.

## Additional Context

{/* Please share any additional context you think the judges should take into consideration as it relates to your One Byte Explainer. */}

> A 64-bit system can handle more data at once than 32-bit, like using 64 fingers instead of 32, hence the analogy of a Highway with multiple lanes and Bypass road with 2 lanes.
