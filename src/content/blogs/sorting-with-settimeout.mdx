# Sorting with setTimeout: A JavaScript Curiosity

setTimeout function of the Web API's with Javascript; can sort an array.

Example:

```javascript
[111, 20, 13, 4, 544, 32, 12, 414, 123].forEach((item) => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(item), item);
});
```

The same works for negative as well,
Example:

```javascript
let arr = [10, -100, 650, -25, 5, -50];

const min = -Math.min(...arr);

arr.forEach((item) => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(item), item + min);
});
```

Any guesses how?
Of course, not an efficient way to do it.

Clue: Call-Stack and Web API's
