## Issue #41: Container Queries & Freelancing Lessons ðŸ“¦

### CSS Container Queries: Finally Here!

After years of waiting, container queries are finally stable across all browsers. This changes **everything** about responsive design:

```css
.sidebar {
  container-type: inline-size;
  container-name: sidebar;
}

@container sidebar (min-width: 300px) {
  .widget {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```

No more media queries based on viewport! Components can now respond to their own size.

### One Year Freelancing: The Brutal Truth

Last week marked my first anniversary as a freelance developer. Here's what I wish someone had told me:

**The Good:**
- 3x salary increase
- Complete control over tech stack
- Working with amazing startups

**The Challenging:**
- Irregular income (some months feast, others famine)
- Self-discipline is HARD
- Imposter syndrome hits different when you're on your own

**Key Lesson**: Always have 6 months expenses saved. Always.

### Productivity Stack That Actually Works

After trying hundreds of tools, here's what stuck:

1. **Notion** - All project docs and client communication
2. **Linear** - Task management (beats Jira by miles)
3. **CleanShot X** - Screenshots and screen recordings
4. **Raycast** - App launcher on steroids
5. **Obsidian** - Personal knowledge management

The secret isn't the toolsâ€”it's picking a few and sticking with them.

## Quick Tips ðŸ’¡

- Use `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` for quick performance debugging
- `git commit --amend` saves you from embarrassing typos in commit messages
- Set up GitHub Actions for automatic dependency updates (Dependabot is your friend)

See you next week,
Shravan
