Welcome to your wiki. This page is authored in MDX and rendered directly.

## Getting Started

- Add new notes in `src/content/wiki/your-note.mdx`
- Use frontmatter fields: `title`, `date`, `tags`, `section`, `description`
- Notes appear in the left sidebar grouped by `section`

```ts
// Example snippet
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
