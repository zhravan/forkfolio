# Blockchain Voting System

A decentralized voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain that ensures transparency, immutability, and security in electoral processes.

## Core Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: All voting logic implemented in Solidity smart contracts
- **Immutable Records**: Votes stored permanently on blockchain
- **Transparent Process**: All transactions publicly verifiable
- **Anonymous Voting**: Voter privacy maintained while ensuring authenticity

## Technical Implementation

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity for voting logic
- **Frontend**: React with Web3.js integration
- **Storage**: IPFS for candidate information
- **Wallet**: MetaMask integration
- **Network**: Ethereum mainnet and testnets
