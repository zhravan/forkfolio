# API Gateway & Microservices Architecture

A comprehensive microservices platform demonstrating enterprise-grade patterns for building scalable, distributed systems. This project showcases modern DevOps practices and cloud-native technologies.

## System Components

### API Gateway
- **Request Routing**: Intelligent routing to appropriate microservices
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across service instances
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation and user authorization
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect services from abuse and overload
- **Monitoring**: Request logging and metrics collection

### Core Microservices
- **User Service**: User registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Product Service**: Product catalog management and inventory tracking
- **Order Service**: Order processing workflow and payment integration
- **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, and push notifications

## Technical Features

- **Service Discovery**: Consul for dynamic service registration
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability
- **Security**: mTLS for secure service-to-service communication
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline with GitLab
